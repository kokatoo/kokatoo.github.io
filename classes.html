                                        We will learn how to develop fun games using the Racket language. Racket is a Lisp that is based on Scheme and it has a powerful set of libraries. It comes with DrRacket, a simple IDE that is easy to set up. Racket is also a popular teaching language in universities (and the famous MIT SCIP textbook is based on Scheme) as it instills an expressive functional base programming style for new coders. Beginners will not be bogged down with having to learn and memorize esoteric syntax and jump straight to learning the beauty and fundamentals of coding.

                                        We will be using the 2htdp/universe library to develop simulation and games such as traffic lights, bouncing balls on different planets, and snake game. Please refer to our <a href="2020/10/02/day1-lesson-plan.html">past coding camp blog</a> for more examples.
