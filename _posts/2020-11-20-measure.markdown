A simple explanation of Measure Theory is the distribution of mass over a set $$\Omega$$. A measurable space is defined as the pair $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ consisting of a nonempty set $$\Omega$$ and a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$\mathcal{F}$$ on $$\Omega$$. In the context of probability measure space, you can think of $$\Omega$$ as the possible outcomes and $$\mathcal{F}$$ as the set of subsets of $$\Omega$$ of possible events. A measure is a way to assign a number to each set of the $$\sigma$$-algebra and you can think of it as a rigorous way to define length, area, volume, and size in general for now. The ultimate aim is to define probability measures which we will talk about it in future posts.

## <a name="sigma"></a>$$\sigma$$-Algebra

$$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\Omega$$ is defined as a special collection of subsets of $$\Omega$$ with the following conditions:

(a)<span style="margin-left: 30px;"></span> $$\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$$

(b)<span style="margin-left: 30px;"></span> $$\mathrm{If}\: A \in \mathcal{F},\: \mathrm{then} \: A^{c} \in \mathcal{F}$$

(c)<span style="margin-left: 30px;"></span> $$\mathrm{If}\: A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots \in \mathcal{F}, \: \mathrm{then} \: \cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} \in \mathcal{F}$$

Note that condition (c) postulates that $$\sigma$$-algebra are closed w.r.t countable unions. Furthermore, it also implies that it is closed w.rt. intersection and set differences $$(A_{1} \setminus A_{2} = A_{1} \cap A_{2}^{c})$$ as well and can be proved using condition (b) and DeMorgan's Law. Conditions (a) and (b) also imply that $$\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$$.

Any set in a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ is called a measurable set as there will be a way to assign a measure to it w.r.t to the $$\sigma$$-algebra. More of this in future posts.

An example of a $$\sigma$$-algebra which is also the smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F} &= \{\Omega, \emptyset\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

with the conditions fulfilled:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Omega &\in \mathcal{F}\\
\Omega^{c} &= \emptyset\\
\emptyset^{c} &= \Omega\\
\Omega \cup \emptyset &= \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The power set $$\mathcal{P}(\Omega) \subset 2^{\Omega}$$ which is a set of all subsets is also a $$\sigma$$-algebra and also the largest $$\sigma$$-algebra you can produce. All other $$\sigma$$-algebra are subsets of $$\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$$ which may not be countable but would still satisfy condition (c).

A simple and smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra that consist of set system $$A$$ would be $$\{\Omega, \emptyset, A, A^{c}\}$$.

### Trace of a set system and $$\sigma$$-Algebra

A set system on a set $$\Omega$$ is a set of subsets of $$\Omega$$ and is not necessarily a $$\sigma$$-algebra. Let $${\Omega_{0}} \subset \Omega$$ and $$\mathcal{E}$$ a set system on $$\Omega$$. Then the trace of $$\mathcal{E}$$ in $$\Omega_{0}$$ is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} \mid _{\Omega_{0}} := \{\Omega_{0} \cap A: A \in \mathcal{E}\}
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, the trace of $$\mathcal{F}$$ in $$\Omega_{0}$$ is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F} \mid _{\Omega_{0}} := \{\Omega_{0} \cap A: A \in \mathcal{F}\}
\end{aligned}$$

Remember that we said that given set system $$B \in \mathcal{F}$$, the smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra would be $$\mathcal{F}_{B} = \{\Omega, \emptyset, B, B^{c}\}$$.

The trace of $$\mathcal{F_{B}}$$ in $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ is then defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A} = \{A, \emptyset, A \cap B, A \cap B^{c}\}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$\Omega$$ is no longer an element of $$\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A}$$ and it is replaced by $$A$$.

### Generating set of $$\sigma$$-Algebra

We can generate a $$\sigma$$-algebra from a set system by the following way:

Let $$\mathcal{E}$$ be a set system on $$\Omega \: (\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{P}( \Omega))$$ and let $$(\mathcal{F}_{i} \in I)$$ be the family of all $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\Omega$$ that contain $$\mathcal{E}$$ as a subset. Then we define the $$\sigma$$-algebra generated by $$\mathcal{E}$$ as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma(\mathcal{E}) := \cap_{i \in I}\mathcal{F}_{i}
\end{aligned}$$

and we call the set $$\mathcal{E}$$ a generating set of $$\sigma(\mathcal{E})$$.

The intuitive understanding of this is given a set $$\mathcal{E}$$, we are able to compute a smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra via intersection.

In the earlier example, we noted the trace of $$\mathcal{F_{B}}$$ in $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ is:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A} = \{A, \emptyset, A \cap B, A \cap B^{c}\}
\end{aligned}$$

But this trace is not a $$\sigma$$-algebra. To make it a $$\sigma$$-algebra, we define the generating set of $$\sigma$$-algebra of $$\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A}$$ as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma(\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A}) = \{\Omega, \emptyset, A, A^{c}, A \cap B, A \cap B^{c}, (A \cap B) \cup A^{c}, (A \cap B^{c}) \cup A^{c}\}
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="borel"></a>Borel $$\sigma$$-Algebra

A half-open interval is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
(a, b] := \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x \leq b\}
\end{aligned}$$

and the set system of all half-open intervals in $$\mathbb{R}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} := \{(a, b]: a, b \in \mathbb{R}\: and\: a < b\}
\end{aligned}$$

and the $$\sigma$$-algebra that is generated by $$\mathcal{E}$$ is called the Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\mathbb{R}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B} := \sigma(\mathcal{E})
\end{aligned}$$

The elements of the Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra are known as the Borel sets.

Similarly, we can define half-open rectangles (sides are parallel to the axes) Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} &:= \{(x_{1},\: x_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}: a_{1} < x_{1} \leq b_{1},\: a_{2} < x_{2} \leq b_{2}\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

And finally we can generalized it to half-open cuboids (sides are parallel to the axes) Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\mathbb{R}^n$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} &:= \{(x_{1},\: \cdots,\: x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}: a_{1} < x_{1} \leq b_{1},\: \cdots,\: a_{n} < x_{n} \leq b_{n}\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

Because the class of open sets is too big, we can come up with a Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra that is countably generated and the set of intervals are countable as well:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B} := \sigma(\{(a, b]: a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\: and\: a < b\})
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="measure"></a>Measure

A measure assigns to all elements of a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ a non-negative real number of the interval $$[0, \infty]$$.

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ be a measurable space. A function $$\mu: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is called a measure and $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$$ is called a measure space if

(a) $$\mu(\emptyset) = 0$$

(b) $$\mu(A) \geq 0, \forall A \in \mathcal{F}$$

(c) $$\sigma$$-additivity: If $$A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots \in \mathcal{F}$$ are pairwise disjoint, then $$\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{i})$$

### Properties

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$$ be a measurable space and if $$A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots \in \mathcal{F}$$ are pairwise disjoint

$$\sigma$$-Additivity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

Finite Additivity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{n}A_{i}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\mu(A_{i}), \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

Monotonicity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{if}\: A \subset B,\\
\mu(A) \leq \mu(B)
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="indicator"></a>Indicator Function

Before we continue, let's define the indicator function as we will be using it to introduce other measures:

Let $$A \subset \Omega$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
I_{A}(\omega) &= 1, \mathrm{if}\: \omega \in A\\
I_{A}(\omega) &= 0, \mathrm{if}\: \omega \notin A
\end{aligned}$$

Let the sets $$A, B \subset \Omega$$, the sums and products of indicators are:

$$\begin{aligned}
I_{A}.I_{B} &= I_{A \cap B}\\
I_{A} + I_{B} - I_{A \cap B} &= I_{A \cup B}
\end{aligned}$$

And finally the indicators of products sets:

Let $$A \subset \Omega_{1}, B \subset \Omega_{2}$$,

$$\begin{aligned}
&I_{\omega_{1}}.I_{\omega_{2}} = I_{A \times B}(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2})\\
&\forall(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}) \in \Omega_{1} \times \Omega_{2}\\
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="dirac"></a>Dirac Measure

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ be a measurable space:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta_{\omega}(A) &:= I_{A}(\omega)\\
\forall \omega &\in \mathcal{F}
\end{aligned}$$

Dirac measure measures whether a set $$A$$ contains a given element $$\omega$$.

## <a name="counting"></a>Counting Measure

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ be a measurable space:

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mathrm{if\: A\: is\: finite}, \\
&\mu_{\#}(A) := \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}I_{A}(\omega) \\
&\mathrm{if\: A\: is\: infinite}, \\
&\mu_{\#}(A) := \infty\\
\end{aligned}$$

Counting measure measures the number of elements in $$A$$ and if $$A$$ is finite, $$\mu_{\#}(A)$$ is called the cardinality of $$A$$.

## <a name="lebesgue"></a>Lebesgue Measure

We will show later there is only one measurable space that satisfies the Lebesgue measure: $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$

For $$\mathbb{R}$$, the Lebesgue measure is the length of the interval $$(a, b]$$ on $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{\mathbb{R}}((a, b]) = b - a
\end{aligned}$$

For $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, the Lebesgue measure is the area of the rectangle $$(a_{1}, b_{1}] \times (a_{2}, b_{2}]$$ on $$(\mathbb{R^{2}}, \mathcal{B_{2}})$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}((a_{1}, b_{1}] \times (a_{2}, b_{2}]) = (b_{1} - a_{1}) . (b_{2} - a_{2})
\end{aligned}$$

And subsequently, for $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$,the Lebesgue measure is the volume of the cuboid $$(a, b] \times \cdots \times (a_{n}, b_{n}])$$ on $$(\mathbb{R^{n}}, \mathcal{B_{n}})$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}((a, b] \times \cdots \times (a_{n}, b_{n}])) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n}(b_{i} - a_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="finite"></a>$$\sigma$$-Finite Measure

$$\mu$$ is called a $$\sigma$$-finite measure if there is a sequence $$A_{i} \in \mathcal{F}$$ and $$\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i} = \Omega$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(A_{i}) < \infty, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that all finite measures are also $$\sigma$$-finite measures.

Lebesgue measure $$\lambda$$ on $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$ is also $$\sigma$$-finite even though $$\mu(\mathbb{R}) = \infty$$ because:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{R} &= \cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}[-i, i] \\
\lambda([-i, i]) &= 2i < \infty \\
\forall i &\in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

Another example is the Dirac measure $$\delta_{i}(A) = I_{A}(i)$$ on $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$ with $$i \in \mathbb{N}_{0}, A \in \mathcal{B}$$ because:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{R} &= \cup_{n = 1}^{\infty}[-n, n] \\
\mu([-n, n]) &= n + 1 \\
\forall n &\in \mathbb{N_{0}}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$\mathbb{N}_{0}$$ includes 0 and $$i > 0$$.

## <a name="product"></a>Product Measure

Let $$(\sigma_{i}, \mathcal{F}_{i}, \mu_{i})$$ be measure spaces with $$\sigma$$-finite measures $$\mu_{i}, i = 1, \cdots, n$$, then there exists a uniquely defined product measure (which is $$\sigma$$-finite as well):

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mu_{i} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mu_{n},\\
&\mathrm{on}\: (X_{i = 1}^{n}\Omega_{i}, \otimes_{i = 1}^{n}\mathcal{F}_{i}),\\
&\forall(A_{1}, \cdots, A_{n}) \in \mathcal{F}_{1} \times \cdots \times \mathcal{F}_{n}
\end{aligned}$$

which equal:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mu_{n}(A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n}) = \mu_{1}(A_{1}). \cdots . \mu_{n}(A_{n})
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="continuity"></a>Continuity of a Measure

Let $$(\sigma, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$$ be a measure space, and let $$A_{1}, \cdots , A_{n} \in \mathcal{F}$$.

If $$A_{1} \subset A_{2} \subset \cdots$$ then

$$\begin{aligned}
\lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty}\mu(A_{i}) = \mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

If $$A_{1} \supset A_{2} \supset \cdots$$ and there is one $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ with $$\mu(A_{n}) < \infty$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty}\mu(A_{i}) = \mu(\cap_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

Consider the Legesgue measure $$\lambda\: \mathrm{on}\: (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$ and the intervals $$\{ A_{i} = (x - \frac{1}{i}, x), i \in \mathbb{N}\}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda(\{x\}) &= \lambda(\cap_{i = 1}^{\infty} (x - \frac{1}{i}, x])\\
&= \lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty} \lambda((x - \frac{1}{i}, x])\\
&= \lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{i}\\
&= 0
\end{aligned}$$

Basically the measure for any point in $$\mathbb{R}$$ is $$0$$ and it implies that:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda((a, b]) &= \lambda([a, b])\\
&= \lambda([a, b))\\
&= \lambda((a, b))\\
&= b - a\\
&\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}
\end{aligned}$$

It also implies that the countable union of rational numbers ($$\sigma$$-additivity):

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda(\{x \in [a, b]: x\in \mathbb{Q}\}) &= 0
\end{aligned}$$

even though the Lebesgue measure $$\lambda$$ of all real numbers in the interval is nonzero:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda(\cup_{a \leq x \leq b} \{x\}) &= \lambda([a, b])\\
&= b - a
\end{aligned}$$
