A measurable space is defined as the pair $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ consisting of a nonempty set $$\Omega$$ and a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$\mathcal{F}$$ on $$\Omega$$. In the context of probability measure space, you can think of $$\Omega$$ as the set of all possible outcomes (sample space) and $$\mathcal{F}$$ as the set of subsets (set of sets) of $$\Omega$$ which are defined as events. A measure is a way to assign a number to each set of the $$\sigma$$-algebra (events) and you can think of it as a rigorous way to define length, area, volume, and size.

## <a name="sigma"></a>$$\sigma$$-Algebra

$$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\Omega$$ is defined as a collection of subsets of $$\Omega$$ with the following conditions:

(a)<span style="margin-left: 30px;"></span> $$\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$$

(b)<span style="margin-left: 30px;"></span> $$\mathrm{If}\: A \in \mathcal{F},\: \mathrm{then} \: A^{c} \in \mathcal{F}$$

(c)<span style="margin-left: 30px;"></span> $$\mathrm{If}\: A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots \in \mathcal{F}, \: \mathrm{then} \: \cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} \in \mathcal{F}$$

Note that condition (c) postulates that $$\sigma$$-algebra are closed w.r.t countable unions. Furthermore, it also implies that it is closed w.rt. intersection and set differences $$(A_{1} \setminus A_{2} = A_{1} \cap A_{2}^{c})$$ as well and can be proved using condition (b) and DeMorgan's Law. Conditions (a) and (b) also imply that $$\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$$.

Any set in a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ is called a measurable set as there will be a way to assign a measure to it w.r.t to the $$\sigma$$-algebra. More of this in future posts.

An example of a $$\sigma$$-algebra which is also the smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F} &= \{\Omega, \emptyset\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

with the conditions fulfilled:

$$\begin{aligned}
\Omega &\in \mathcal{F}\\
\Omega^{c} &= \emptyset\\
\emptyset^{c} &= \Omega\\
\Omega \cup \emptyset &= \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The power set $$\mathcal{P}(\Omega) \subset 2^{\Omega}$$ which is a set of all subsets is also a $$\sigma$$-algebra and also the largest $$\sigma$$-algebra you can produce. All other $$\sigma$$-algebra are subsets of $$\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$$ which may not be countable but would still satisfy condition (c). Usually the power set will be too big to assign a measure with and we will have to contend with a smaller $$\sigma$$-algebra (Borel Sets). Note that it is fine for $$\sigma$$-algebra to be uncountable infinite, but it has to be closed under countable unions. This is not the case for $$2^{\mathbb{R}}$$. But as long as $$\Omega$$ is finite or countable then it is fine to take the power set as the $$\sigma$$-algebra.

A simple and smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra that consist of set $$A$$ would be $$\{\Omega, \emptyset, A, A^{c}\}$$.

### Trace of a set system and $$\sigma$$-Algebra

A set system on a set $$\Omega$$ is a set of subsets of $$\Omega$$ that is not necessarily a $$\sigma$$-algebra. Let $${\Omega_{0}} \subset \Omega$$ and $$\mathcal{E}$$ a set system on $$\Omega$$. Then the trace of $$\mathcal{E}$$ in $$\Omega_{0}$$ is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} \mid _{\Omega_{0}} := \{\Omega_{0} \cap A: A \in \mathcal{E}\}
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, the trace of $$\mathcal{F}$$ in $$\Omega_{0}$$ is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F} \mid _{\Omega_{0}} := \{\Omega_{0} \cap A: A \in \mathcal{F}\}
\end{aligned}$$

Remember that we said that given set system $$B \in \mathcal{F}$$, the smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra would be $$\mathcal{F}_{B} = \{\Omega, \emptyset, B, B^{c}\}$$.

The trace of $$\mathcal{F_{B}}$$ in $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ is then defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A} = \{A, \emptyset, A \cap B, A \cap B^{c}\}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$\Omega$$ is no longer an element of $$\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A}$$ and it is replaced by $$A$$.

### Generating set of $$\sigma$$-Algebra

We can generate a $$\sigma$$-algebra from a set system by the following way:

Let $$\mathcal{E}$$ be a set system on $$\Omega \: (\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{P}( \Omega))$$ and let $$(\mathcal{F}_{i} \in I)$$ be the family of all $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\Omega$$ that contain $$\mathcal{E}$$ as a subset. Then we define the $$\sigma$$-algebra generated by $$\mathcal{E}$$ as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma(\mathcal{E}) := \cap_{i \in I}\mathcal{F}_{i}
\end{aligned}$$

and we call the set $$\mathcal{E}$$ a generating set of $$\sigma(\mathcal{E})$$.

The intuitive understanding of this is given a set $$\mathcal{E}$$, we are able to compute a smallest $$\sigma$$-algebra via intersection. Note that we can prove an intersection of $$\sigma$$-algebras will always produce a $$\sigma$$-algebra, but this is not the case for unions.

In the earlier example, we noted the trace of $$\mathcal{F_{B}}$$ in $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ is:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A} = \{A, \emptyset, A \cap B, A \cap B^{c}\}
\end{aligned}$$

But this trace is not a $$\sigma$$-algebra. To make it a $$\sigma$$-algebra, we define the generating set of $$\sigma$$-algebra of $$\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A}$$ as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma(\mathcal{F_{B}} \mid _{A}) = \{\Omega, \emptyset, A, A^{c}, A \cap B, A \cap B^{c}, (A \cap B) \cup A^{c}, (A \cap B^{c}) \cup A^{c}\}
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="borel"></a>Borel $$\sigma$$-Algebra

When $$\Omega$$ is uncountable, for example $$\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$, we cannot take the power set as the $$\sigma$$-algebra because the power set of an uncountable set is too big to assign a measure to it. For example, we can show that it is impossible to assign a uniform probability measure on the interval $$\Omega = (0, 1]$$ for all subsets $$2^{\Omega}$$. We would need to define a smaller set of $$\sigma$$-algebra that consists of intervals.

Consider a half-open interval:

$$\begin{aligned}
(a, b] := \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x \leq b\}
\end{aligned}$$

and the set system of all half-open intervals in $$\mathbb{R}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} := \{(a, b]: a, b \in \mathbb{R}\: and\: a < b\}
\end{aligned}$$

We will show later that we can assign a Lebesgue measure on these interval, but in order to make these intervals a $$\sigma$$-algebra, we would need to complete it by adding the complement, countable unions, and etc by generating it from $$\mathcal{E}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B} := \sigma(\mathcal{E})
\end{aligned}$$

The elements of the Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra are known as the Borel sets.

But how do we know the Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra is not the power set itself? One can show that the cardinality of Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra is the same as the real numbers $$\| \mathcal{B} \| = \| \mathbb{R} \|$$.

Similarly, we can define half-open rectangles (sides are parallel to the axes) Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} &:= \{(x_{1},\: x_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}: a_{1} < x_{1} \leq b_{1},\: a_{2} < x_{2} \leq b_{2}\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

And finally we can generalized it to half-open cuboids (sides are parallel to the axes) Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra on $$\mathbb{R}^n$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{E} &:= \{(x_{1},\: \cdots,\: x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}: a_{1} < x_{1} \leq b_{1},\: \cdots,\: a_{n} < x_{n} \leq b_{n}\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

Because the class of open sets is uncountable, we can come up with a Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra that is countably generated and the set of intervals are countable as well:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B} := \sigma(\{(a, b]: a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\: and\: a < b\})
\end{aligned}$$

One example of Borel sets are singletons $$\{x; x \in \mathbb{R}\}$$. We can show that the following countable intersection of intervals equal to the singleton:

$$\begin{aligned}
\{x\} &= \cap_{i = 1}^{\infty}(x - \frac{1}{i}, x]\\
\end{aligned}$$

Once we show that singletons are Borel sets, we can show the following intervals are Borel sets:

$$\begin{aligned}
(a, b) &= (a, b] \setminus \{b\}\\
[a, b) &= (a, b] \cup \{b\}\\
[a, b] &= (a, b] \cup \{a\}\\
\end{aligned}$$

So it doesn't matter whether the intervals are open, closed, or half-open. The reason for starting off with the half-open interval is due to the half-open interval being used in the [Carathéodory's extension theorem]({% post_url 2020-11-20-measure %}#cara) where a $$\sigma$$-algebra generated by a collection of subsets of $$\Omega = (0, 1]$$ which are finite and disjoint half-open intervals and a measure that is defined on this set can be uniquely extended to the full $$\sigma$$-algebra which turns out to be the same as the Borel sets.  In summary it doesn't matter whether you start off with a open , closed, or half-open intervals.

Another example is the Cantor set. Cantor set can be created by recursively removing the middle-third of the open interval $$(0, 1)$$ infinitely. The Cantor set is whatever that remains and we can show that it is uncountable and has the same cardinality as $$\mathbb{R}$$. By construction the Cantor set doesn't have any intervals and the complement is a countable union of open intervals which we removed. Since the complement is a Borel set, the Cantor set is a Borel set as well.

So if Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra does not contain the power set, what are examples of sets that are not Borel sets? Surprisingly, it is not easy to construct a set that is not a Borel set. For example, certain continued fractions of irrational numbers are non-Borel sets. Another example is the Vitali set that is both non-Borel and non-measurable. Note that it is still possible to assign a measure to some non-Borel sets but from the perspective of a probability measure, we are only interested in Borel sets.

## <a name="measure"></a>Measure

A measure function $$\mu()$$ assigns to all elements of a $$\sigma$$-algebra $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ a non-negative real number of the interval $$[0, \infty]$$. Note that $$\infty$$ is included in the image.

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ be a measure space. A function $$\mu: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is called a measure and $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$$ is called a measure space if

(a) $$\mu(\emptyset) = 0$$

(b) $$\mu(A) \geq 0, \forall A \in \mathcal{F}$$

(c) $$\sigma$$-additivity: If $$A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots \in \mathcal{F}$$ are pairwise disjoint, then $$\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{i})$$

It is a probability measure if $$\mu(\Omega) = 1$$ and this also implies that $$\mu(\emptyset) = 0$$.

### Properties

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$$ be a measurable space and if $$A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots \in \mathcal{F}$$ are pairwise disjoint

$$\sigma$$-Additivity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

Finite Additivity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{n}A_{i}) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\mu(A_{i})\\
\forall n &\in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

Monotonicity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{if}\: A &\subseteq B,\\
\mu(A) &\leq \mu(B)\\
\end{aligned}$$

We can show this is the case as $$B = A \cup (B \setminus A)$$ and from finite additivity $$\mu(B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B \setminus A)$$.

## <a name="indicator"></a>Indicator Function

Before we continue, let's define the indicator function as we will be using it to introduce other measures:

Let $$A \subset \Omega$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
I_{A}(\omega) &= 1, \mathrm{if}\: \omega \in A\\
I_{A}(\omega) &= 0, \mathrm{if}\: \omega \notin A
\end{aligned}$$

Let the sets $$A, B \subset \Omega$$, the sums and products of indicators are:

$$\begin{aligned}
I_{A}.I_{B} &= I_{A \cap B}\\
I_{A} + I_{B} - I_{A \cap B} &= I_{A \cup B}
\end{aligned}$$

And finally the indicators of products sets:

Let $$A \subset \Omega_{1}, B \subset \Omega_{2}$$,

$$\begin{aligned}
&I_{\omega_{1}}.I_{\omega_{2}} = I_{A \times B}(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2})\\
&\forall(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}) \in \Omega_{1} \times \Omega_{2}\\
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="dirac"></a>Dirac Measure

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ be a measurable space:

$$\begin{aligned}
\delta_{\omega}(A) &:= I_{A}(\omega)\\
\forall \omega &\in \mathcal{F}
\end{aligned}$$

Dirac measure measures whether a set $$A$$ contains a given element $$\omega$$.

## <a name="counting"></a>Counting Measure

Let $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ be a measurable space:

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mathrm{if\: A\: is\: finite}, \\
&\mu_{\#}(A) := \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}I_{A}(\omega) \\
&\mathrm{if\: A\: is\: infinite}, \\
&\mu_{\#}(A) := \infty\\
\end{aligned}$$

Counting measure measures the number of elements in $$A$$ and if $$A$$ is finite, $$\mu_{\#}(A)$$ is called the cardinality of $$A$$.

## <a name="lebesgue"></a>Lebesgue Measure

The Lebesgue measure is a measure on the measurable space: $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$. In other words, we are assigning a measure to the Borel sets in the Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra.

For $$\mathbb{R}$$, the Lebesgue measure is the length of the interval $$(a, b]$$ on $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{\mathbb{R}}((a, b]) = b - a
\end{aligned}$$

For $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, the Lebesgue measure is the area of the rectangle $$(a_{1}, b_{1}] \times (a_{2}, b_{2}]$$ on $$(\mathbb{R^{2}}, \mathcal{B_{2}})$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}((a_{1}, b_{1}] \times (a_{2}, b_{2}]) = (b_{1} - a_{1}) . (b_{2} - a_{2})
\end{aligned}$$

And subsequently, for $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$,the Lebesgue measure is the volume of the cuboid $$(a, b] \times \cdots \times (a_{n}, b_{n}])$$ on $$(\mathbb{R^{n}}, \mathcal{B_{n}})$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}((a, b] \times \cdots \times (a_{n}, b_{n}])) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n}(b_{i} - a_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="finite"></a>$$\sigma$$-Finite Measure

$$\mu$$ is called a $$\sigma$$-finite measure if there is a sequence $$A_{i} \in \mathcal{F}$$ and $$\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i} = \Omega$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(A_{i}) < \infty, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that all finite measures are also $$\sigma$$-finite measures.

Lebesgue measure $$\lambda$$ on $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$ is also $$\sigma$$-finite even though $$\mu(\mathbb{R}) = \infty$$ because:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{R} &= \cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}[-i, i] \\
\lambda([-i, i]) &= 2i < \infty \\
\forall i &\in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

Another example is the Dirac measure $$\delta_{i}(A) = I_{A}(i)$$ on $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$ with $$i \in \mathbb{N}_{0}, A \in \mathcal{B}$$ because:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{R} &= \cup_{n = 1}^{\infty}[-n, n] \\
\mu([-n, n]) &= n + 1 \\
\forall n &\in \mathbb{N_{0}}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$\mathbb{N}_{0}$$ includes 0 and $$i > 0$$.

## <a name="product"></a>Product Measure

Let $$(\sigma_{i}, \mathcal{F}_{i}, \mu_{i})$$ be measure spaces with $$\sigma$$-finite measures $$\mu_{i}, i = 1, \cdots, n$$, then there exists a uniquely defined product measure (which is $$\sigma$$-finite as well):

$$\begin{aligned}
&\mu_{i} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mu_{n},\\
&\mathrm{on}\: (X_{i = 1}^{n}\Omega_{i}, \otimes_{i = 1}^{n}\mathcal{F}_{i}),\\
&\forall(A_{1}, \cdots, A_{n}) \in \mathcal{F}_{1} \times \cdots \times \mathcal{F}_{n}
\end{aligned}$$

which equal:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mu_{n}(A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n}) = \mu_{1}(A_{1}). \cdots . \mu_{n}(A_{n})
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="continuity"></a>Continuity of a Measure

Let $$(\sigma, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$$ be a measure space, and if $$A_{1}, \cdots , A_{n} \in \mathcal{F}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}) &= \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{n}A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

Essentially we are taking the limit out of $$\mu$$.

To prove the theorem, we define a new set $$B_{n}$$ and claim that it is pairwise disjoint which we can prove by contradiction:

$$\begin{aligned}
B_{n} &= A_{n} \setminus \cup_{i = 1}^{n - 1} A_{i}\\
B_{i} &\cap B_{j} = \emptyset\\
\forall &i, j \geq 1
\end{aligned}$$

We also claim the following without proof:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}) &= \mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} B_{i})\\
\end{aligned}$$

Since $$B_{i}$$ are pairwise disjoint and using $$\sigma$$-additivity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} A_{i}) &= \mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty} B_{i})\\
&= \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\mu(B_{i})\\
&= \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{n}B_{i})\\
&= \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{n}A_{i})\\
\end{aligned}$$

As a corollary from the above theorem, if $$A_{1} \subset A_{2} \subset \cdots$$ then

$$\begin{aligned}
\lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty}\mu(A_{i}) = \mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$A_{i}$$ are monotonically increasing.

Also we can show if $$A_{1} \supset A_{2} \supset \cdots$$ and there is one $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ with $$\mu(A_{n}) < \infty$$ using DeMorgan's Law:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty}\mu(A_{i}) = \mu(\cap_{i = 1}^{\infty}A_{i})
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$A_{i}$$ are monotonically decreasing.

And in both cases, note that we took the limit out from inside of the $$\mu$$ function to the outside.

Now let's consider the Lebesgue measure $$\lambda\: \mathrm{on}\: (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$$ and the intervals $$\{ A_{i} = (x - \frac{1}{i}, x), i \in \mathbb{N}\}$$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda(\{x\}) &= \lambda(\cap_{i = 1}^{\infty} (x - \frac{1}{i}, x])\\
&= \lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty} \lambda((x - \frac{1}{i}, x])\\
&= \lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{i}\\
&= 0
\end{aligned}$$

Basically the measure for any point in $$\mathbb{R}$$ is $$0$$ and it implies that:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda((a, b]) &= \lambda([a, b])\\
&= \lambda([a, b))\\
&= \lambda((a, b))\\
&= b - a\\
&\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}
\end{aligned}$$

It also implies that the countable union of rational numbers ($$\sigma$$-additivity):

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda(\{x \in [a, b]: x\in \mathbb{Q}\}) &= 0
\end{aligned}$$

even though the Lebesgue measure $$\lambda$$ of all real numbers in the interval is nonzero:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda(\cup_{a \leq x \leq b} \{x\}) &= \lambda([a, b])\\
&= b - a
\end{aligned}$$

## <a name="cara"></a>Carathéodory's Extension Theorem

We know Lebesgue measure for intervals, but how do we extend the measure to all Borel sets? Carathéodory's extension theorem states that it is possible to extend the Lebesgue measure uniquely on all Borel sets. We do not need to know how to measure all Borel sets but it suffices to know that there is one unique way to extend the measure.

Let $$\Omega = (0, 1]$$ and

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F_{0}} &= \{\emptyset, \{(a_{1}, b_{1}] \cup (a_{2}, b_{2}] \cup \cdots \cup (a_{n}, b_{n}]\}\}\\
\forall&\: 0 \leq a_{1} < b_{1} \leq \cdots a_{n} < b_{n}, n \in \mathbb{N}
\end{aligned}$$

We know that the Lebesgue measure for:

$$\begin{aligned}
\lambda((a_{1}, b_{1}] \cup (a_{2}, b_{2}] \cup \cdots \cup (a_{n}, b_{n}]) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(b_{i} - a_{i})\\
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$\mathcal{F_{0}}$$ is an algebra (closed under finite union not countable union) but not a $$\sigma$$-algebra. 

Carathéodory's extension theorem states that we can extend the above measure to a unique measure $$\mu()$$ for $$\sigma$$-algebra $$\mathcal{F} = \sigma(\mathcal{F_{0}})$$ such that:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu(A) &= \lambda(A)\\
\forall &A \in \mathcal{F_{0}}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that $$\mathcal{F}$$ is a Borel $$\sigma$$-algebra:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F} &= \sigma(\mathcal{F_{0}}) \\
&= \mathcal{B}\\
\end{aligned}$$
